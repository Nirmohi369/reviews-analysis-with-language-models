# Amazon Product Reviews Analysis with Language Models

### Description:
This repository contains code and documentation for a sentiment analysis project that evaluates the performance of two different Large Language Models (LLMs) on Amazon product reviews. The project utilizes DistilBERT and a Multilingual BERT model for sentiment analysis, comparing their effectiveness in classifying reviews as positive or negative.

### Contents:
1. Code: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison.
2. Data: Includes a preprocessed dataset of Amazon product reviews used for training and testing the models.
3. Documentation: Contains detailed analysis reports, including model selection rationale, data overview, model architecture, training approach, evaluation metrics, and comparison of results.
4. README.md: Provides an overview of the project, instructions for replicating the analysis, and considerations for model selection.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Nirmohi369/reviews-analysis-with-language-models.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd sentiment-analysis-amazon-reviews
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the code scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
5. Refer to the documentation for detailed analysis reports and insights.

### Dependencies:
